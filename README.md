## Device manager application


#The objective of this program is to create a device manager application that allows users to model different types of devices using object-oriented programming principles, specifically inheritance and polymorphism. Users interact with a JavaFX GUI to create and manage different types of devices, each with specific attributes. 
The program includes a base class (Device), three derived classes (Smartphone, Laptop, Tablet), and a GUI interface where users can add, view, and remove devices from a list.
